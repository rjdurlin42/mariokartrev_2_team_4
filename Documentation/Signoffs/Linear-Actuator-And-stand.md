Detail Design: Linear Actuator and Stand

<br/><br/>


**Function of the Subsystem:** 
<br/><br/>
The function of the linear actuator stand subsystem is to provide a base for the linear actuator during Mario Kart gameplay and ride replay simulations. The linear actuator 
stand will also house the linear actuator controller. The function of the linear actuator stand is to provide a base for the linear actuator during Mario Kart simulations. 
The linear actuator stand also houses the linear actuator controller. The linear motor’s function is to receive input from the motor control subsystem and provide a feedback 
system to the control.
<br/><br/>

**Constraints:**
<br/><br/>
Stability: The Linear Actuator Stand shall be level and secured tightly to the frame of the Mario Kart simulator using a pipe strap to provide stability to the linear 
actuator.  
<br/>
Design and Construction: The Linear Actuator Stand shall be constructed of Plexiglas, allowing for fasteners to be attached for the linear actuator. Pipe straps will enable 
the Linear Actuator Stand to be attached to the Mario Kart Bike stand. The Linear Actuator Stand will have openings for the power and feedback to and from the linear 
actuator.

**Buildable schematic:**
<br/><br/>
The 3D model for the Linear Actuator Stand is provided in Figure 1.

**Analysis:**
<br/><br/>
An analysis and visual inspection have been performed on existing components of the Mario Kart Bike to understand the feasibility of the use of different materials for 
construction of the Linear Actuator Stand Subsystem. A 3D printed plastic component critical to the Steering Subsystem in the previous design failed after minimal use. 
Therefore, the Linear Actuator Stand Subsystem will be constructed of Plexiglas to ensure that it is sturdy enough to house and stabilize the Linear Actuator. The strongest 
material for construction would be metal, however, after analysis, it was decided that metal was not a possibility, as the stand would act as a Faraday cage, interfering with 
the wireless signal of actuator control that is located inside the box. Plexiglas is chosen for the best material for construction as it can be cut at the Maker Space in the 
laboratory. A pipe strap will be sufficient to attach the Linear Actuator Stand to the Mario Kart Bike stand. The Linear Actuator Stand will be sturdy enough to stabilize the 
linear actuator and protect it from accidental damage during normal use of the Mario Kart Bike. The stand is to have one 10 mm hole for the actuator cable and a 9.9 mm by 5 
mm rectangular opening for the AMASS XT30 power connector.

# Mario Kart Bike V2

## Executive Summary

This capstone project improves upon the previous iteration of the Mario Kart Bike, adding a more dynamic resistance system, as well as a new mode: Ride Replay Simulation. This mode allows users to record a bike ride, and then replay it later on indoors. Using data gathered from various sensors and an internal physics engine, the replay will calculate whether to speed up or slow down video playback based on the speed the user is pedalling at, as well as what resistance to apply. The resistance system will utilize 85 states, creating a smooth and realistic replay. This resistance system also works in the original Mario Kart Mode, using Nintendo Switch rumble states to determine what resistance to apply.


## Capabilities

As of right now, we have not begun physical construction of any planned subsystems. However, we have submitted signoffs for the Resistance System, HDMI Switching System, Power System, Bluetooth System, 


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!

## About Us

### Team

Team 4 is a 5-person Capstone Design Project Team at Tennessee Technological University, who began Revision 2 of the Mario Kart Simulation Project during the Fall 2022 semester. Team 4â€™s project is to further enhance the riding experience offered by the existing design by adding a variable of resistance for two modes of operation: the Mario Kart game simulation and a pre-recorded trail ride simulation using data from an actual trail in Cookeville, TN. Team members are Blake Pickett, Tyler Chittum, Benjamin Reed, Ray Durlin, and Sage Mooneyham. Team 4 collaborated to add a variable of magnetic resistance to the design for both modes of operation. Additionally, each member made individual contributions to the design. Blake Pickett is an Electrical Engineer; he designed modifications to the sensor system to enable the conversion to wireless technology and designed modifications to the steering system to convert it from 3-D printed plastic to more durable metal. Tyler Chittum is an Electrical Engineer; he designed the ride replay simulation acquisition system. Benjamin Reed is a Computer Engineer; he designed the HDMI switching system. Ray Durlin is an Electrical Engineer; he designed the power distribution system. Sage Mooneyham is a Computer Engineer; he designed the Bluetooth system. Team 4 will conclude the project during the Spring 2023 semester. Jesse Roberts is the supervising faculty member, customer, and professor for the project. The intended userbase is very broad.

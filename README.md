# Mario Kart Bike V2

## Executive Summary

This capstone project improves upon the previous iteration of the Mario Kart Bike, adding a more dynamic resistance system, as well as a new mode: Ride Replay Simulation. This mode allows users to record a bike ride, and then replay it later on indoors. Using data gathered from various sensors and an internal physics engine, the replay will calculate whether to speed up or slow down video playback based on the speed the user is pedalling at, as well as what resistance to apply. The resistance system will utilize 85 states, creating a smooth and realistic replay. This resistance system also works in the original Mario Kart Mode, using Nintendo Switch rumble states to determine what resistance to apply.


## Capabilities

As of right now, we have not begun physical construction of any planned subsystems. However, we have submitted signoffs for the Resistance System, HDMI Switching System, Bluetooth System, Power Distribution System, Ride Replay Simulation Acquisition (RRSA) System, and the Sensor System.


## Salient Outcomes

Outcomes of the project will be posted here when production is completed.


## Project Demonstration & Images

We plan on posting a link to a video showcasing the Mario Kart Bike, as well as images of the project when production is completed.

## About Us

### Team

Team 4 is a 5-person Capstone Design Project Team at Tennessee Technological University, who began Revision 2 of the Mario Kart Simulation Project during the Fall 2022 semester. Team members are Blake Pickett, Ray Durlin, Tyler Chittum, Benjamin Reed, and Sage Mooneyham. All members worked on the Resistance System.

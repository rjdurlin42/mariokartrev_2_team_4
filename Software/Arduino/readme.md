# Arduino Code
This folder holds the code for the steering and speed sensor. This has both the serial and wireless method of communication with the speed sensor. Dependencies are found in the include instruction at the top of each file. To run code on sensors, download the files in this folder, install Arduino IDE, install dependencies in Arduino IDE, and upload code to individual Nanos via USB.

# Steering L-Bracket Subsystem 
## Team 4 - Blake Pickett ##

_Function of the Subsystem:_

Modifications to the Steering L-Bracket Subsystem will provide stabilized support to ensure that the Gear attached to the Potentiometer meshes with the Gear attached to the handlebars. Both Gears mesh in order for the Mario Kart Bike to perform as designed. The purpose or function of the modifications to the Steering L-Bracket Subsystem is to replace the plastic 3D printed L-Bracket with a metal component and properly attach it to the Mario Kart Bike’s steering column. These revisions will stabilize the Steering Subsystem and increase steering fidelity while creating a form that is more like commercial products.  

_Constraints:_ 

**Increased Fidelity:** The Steering L-Bracket mechanism shall be strengthened using a metal component. 

**Adaptability to Steering Column:** The L-Bracket shall be positioned at least one quarter of an inch off the surface of the Mario Kart Bike’s steering column in order to bypass an existing rubber seal and to be properly secured in place.

_Buildable Schematic:_

**Figures 1**, **2**, and **3** show a 3D model of the Steering L-Bracket Subsystem.

_Analysis:_ 

An analysis has been performed to determine the performance of the existing Steering Subsystem. The results of the analysis and visual inspection indicate that the existing L-Bracket cannot perform as intended. The L-Bracket must be strengthened rather than simply re-placed with a new plastic 3D printed component. The analysis verified that the Steering L-Bracket must be fabricated from metal rather than plastic, and it must be properly secured to the Mario Kart Bike. 

Although analysis indicated that the existing clamps did not break while in use for the previous design, they were not an effective means of attaching/stabilizing the Steering L-Bracket to the steering column because the L-Bracket came in contact with the rubber seal on the Mario Kart Bike’s steering column. Therefore, the clamps must be replaced with conduit hangers to hold the L-Bracket off the surface of the steering column in order to clear the rubber seal.

Specifically, modifications include strengthening the Steering L-Bracket mechanism using a new stainless-steel L-Bracket measuring 12 inches by 7 inches by 2 inches to replace the plastic 3-D printed component. The new metal Steering L-Bracket will be attached to the steering column using two 1-inch conduit hangers. A diagram of the conduit hangers is provided in **Figure 4**. Two holes will be drilled in the L-Bracket, so it can be bolted to the conduit hangers. 

Incorporating a commercially available L-Bracket is a cost-effective solution for providing the necessary strength and stability. Conduit hangers are also commercially available at a minimal cost.

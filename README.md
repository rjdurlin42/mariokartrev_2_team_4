# Mario Kart Bike V2

## Executive Summary

This capstone project improves upon the previous iteration of the Mario Kart Bike, adding a more dynamic resistance system, as well as a new mode: Ride Replay Simulation. This mode allows users to record a bike ride, and then replay it later on indoors. Using data gathered from various sensors and an internal physics engine, the replay will calculate whether to speed up or slow down video playback based on the speed the user is pedalling at, as well as what resistance to apply. The resistance system will utilize 85 states, creating a smooth and realistic replay. This resistance system also works in the original Mario Kart Mode, using Nintendo Switch rumble states to determine what resistance to apply.


## Capabilities

As of right now, we have not began physical construction of any planned subsystems. However, we have submitted signoffs for the Resistance System, HDMI Switching System, Power System, Bluetooth System, 


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team

Give a brief bio for each team member and their broad contribution to the project (no need to be terribly specifc).

### Faculty Supervisor

The faculty advisor for this project was Jesse Roberts.

### Stakeholders

The main customer for this project was Jesse Roberts, however a commercialized version of this product would likely garner attention from people who enjoy playing Mario Kart, fitness, and/or cycling.

# Steering L-Bracket Subsystem 
## Team 4 - Blake Pickett ##

_Function of the Subsystem:_

The function of the Steering L-Bracket Subsystem is to provide the Mario Kart Bike rider a simulated, but realistic riding experience. Both the Mario Kart game simulation and pre-recorded trail ride simulation are dependent upon the user’s ability to move the steering wheel as he or she navigates the simulated trail(s). Some components of the steering system installed on the current version of the Mario Kart Bike were fabricated of plastic using a 3D printer. The plastic Steering L-Bracket uses a screwdriver as a rigid support because it is not strong enough to support for one Gear and the Potentiometer. Even with the screwdriver as a rigid support, the plastic L-Bracket, has broken. Therefore, a new metal L-Bracket is needed to stabilize the Steering Subsystem and increase steering fidelity.

_Constraints:_ 

The new design includes modification to the Mario Kart Bike Steering L-Bracket Subsystem. The Steering L-Bracket mechanism shall be strengthened using a metal component. Specifically, modifications to the Steering L-Bracket Subsystem will include strengthening the Steering L-Bracket mechanism using a new stainless steel 12” x 7” x 2” L-Bracket to replace the plastic, 3-D printed version. This modification will increase the steering fidelity of the new design. The new metal Steering L-Bracket will be affixed to the steering column using the existing clamps as shown in Figure 1.  

Incorporation of the new, commercially available metal L-Bracket will provide stabilized support for the Potentiometer and the Gear attached to it. The fidelity of the L-Bracket support is necessary to the successful delivery of the enhanced performance of the Mario Kart Bike. Specifically, the L-Bracket is supporting the Potentiometer, which is used to determine the magnitude of the user’s turn when playing Mario Kart. The Potentiometer is turned by the Gear that is attached to it. This Gear must mesh with the Gear attached to the handlebars. A sturdy, rigid L-Bracket must hold the Potentiometer and its Gear in place to ensure that both Gears mesh in order for the Mario Kart Bike to perform as designed. 

In addition to improving the strength and endurance of the L-Bracket support to ensure accurate performance of the new design, the modified Steering L-Bracket subsystem will improve the physical design of the Mario Kart bike and eliminate the need for the screwdriver to create a form that is more like commercial products.

_Analysis:_ 

An analysis has been performed to determine the performance of the existing Steering Subsystem Gears on the Mario Kart Bike, while meeting the ethical constraints for user safety. The visual inspection of the Steering System determined that the 3-D printed Gears perform to specification. However, the results of the analysis and visual inspection indicate that the existing L-Bracket cannot perform as intended. The L-Bracket must be strengthened rather than simply re-placed with a new plastic 3D printed component. The analysis verified that the Steering L-Bracket must be fabricated from metal rather than plastic, and it must be properly secured to the Mario Kart Bike. 

Analysis indicated that the existing clamps are an effective means of attaching the Steering L-Bracket to the steering column. The existing clamps did not break while in use for the previous design.  

Incorporating a commercially available L-Bracket is a cost-effective solution for providing the necessary strength, stability, and endurance required. Additionally, this solution will mitigate the need for a screwdriver as a rigid support for the Steering L-Bracket subsystem, which is critical to the performance of the Potentiometer and Gears. Additional cost avoidance will be achieved by re-using the existing clamps.

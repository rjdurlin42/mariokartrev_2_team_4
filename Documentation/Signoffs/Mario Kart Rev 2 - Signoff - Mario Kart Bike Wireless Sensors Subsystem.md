# Mario Kart Rev 2 - Signoff - Mario Kart Bike Wireless Sensors Subsystem 
## Team 4 - Blake Pickett ##

_Function of the Subsystem:_

The function of the newly designed feature is to convert the speed and steering sensors and the microcontrollers on the Mario Kart Bike to be wireless. These sensors will gather data, converting it in the bike sensors case, and send this via Bluetooth to the master microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi (RPi). Each sensor will be given its own microcontrollers (i.e., the Arduino Nano 33 BLE for the steering sensor and the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for the speed sensor) in order to utilize Bluetooth 5 communication to the central RPi. Coding of the individual microcontrollers and their Bluetooth modules will be accomplished through the use of Arduino IDE text editor. This new feature will mitigate safety risks to the Mario Kart Bike riders by eliminating the long wires running down the bike and around the bike stand, as well as improve the aesthetic form of the product. These long wires are a safety hazard for future customers. The wires that are rectifying and stepping down the power for the sensors on the current version of the Mario Kart Bike will be replaced with a three-AA-battery holder, complete with three AA batteries that will produce 4.5 V and 9 A current to the sensors and microcontrollers.

_Constraints:_ 

The wireless capability provided by the new design requires the removal of the long wires along the bike. Although eliminating the long wires mitigates a safety risk to Mario Kart Bike riders, the equipment must still have power to work properly. Therefore, the long wires will be replaced with batteries. Multiple batteries will supply the DC voltage and current needed to power the equipment. 

**Speed Sensor:** The KY-032 Obstacle Avoidance Sensor must have a DC voltage between 3.3 V and 5 V to operate correctly. Likewise, the KY-032 Obstacle Avoidance Sensor must have a minimum of 20 mA of current to operate correctly. The Nano 33 BLE Sense and Bluetooth module will operate correctly with the given voltage between 3.3 V and 5 V. 

**Steering Sensor:** The Potentiometer voltage must be the same as the analog input, so the voltage for the Potentiometer must be the same as the analog to digital converter (ADC), microcontroller, and Bluetooth module. The ADC has a maximum voltage of 5.5 V and a minimum of 0 V. The Na and Bluetooth module will operate correctly with the given voltage between 3.3 V and 5 V. During the fabrication of the new design, analysis will be performed to ensure that safety risks have been mitigated. Although the long wires will be replaced to mitigate the risk resulting from the potential trip hazard, analysis will be performed to ensure that the batteries are not inducing an unacceptable level of voltage or current onto the Mario Kart Bike frame, posing a potential safety risk to the rider. 

**Data Transfer Method:** In order to improve the physical design of the Mario Kart bike and clean up the exposed wiring to create a form that is more like commercial products, communication between the sensors and main RPi shall be wireless.

_Analysis:_ 

An analysis has been performed to ensure that the existing steering and speed sensors installed on the Mario Kart Bike perform to specification, meeting both the technical requirements and ethical constraints for user safety. The results of the analysis indicate that the sensors are adequate to meet the intended performance, including the enhanced resistance and trail ride features. After verifying the adequacy of the speed and steering sensors, a design was developed to add the convenience of wireless connectivity. To assist in the verification of wireless capability for the speed and steering sensors, schematics were developed to provide illustrations for visual analysis of the design, including a satisfactory, functional means of mounting the batteries needed to achieve the required voltage. Additionally, the use of mathematical calculations enabled the verification of the quantity of batteries needed to provide the required voltage range. Since a single AA battery provides 1.5 V and 3,000 mA, three batteries will provide 4.5 V, which is sufficient voltage within the required range and the required current. The battery holders feature power on/off switches to conserve power / battery life when not in use. The dimensions of the battery holders, measuring 2.681 inches (l) by 1.906 inches (w) by 0.717 inches (h), are small and compact, avoiding the trip hazard posed by the long wires installed on the previous version of the Mario Kart Bike. Additionally, zip ties will be used to neatly and securely mount the battery holder to the Mario Kart bike frame, further promoting the safety of the Mario Kart Bike rider. 

In regards to the Bluetooth connectivity of each sensor, selection of the steering sensor’s microcontroller was the first order of business. The Arduino brand was selected due to their microcontrollers being generally simple, effective, and cheap. From here, the power constraint needed to be focused on, as some Arduino microcontrollers surpass the 5 V limit and others are at 5 V exactly. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE was also selected. The 33 BLE is a low power microcontroller that has an integrated Bluetooth module utilizing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version. BLE is a variation of Bluetooth 4.0, sacrificing range of transmission (100m to 50m) and data throughput (2.1-0.7 Mbps to 0.27 Mbps) in exchange for low power consumption. The loss of range and data throughput are acceptable losses, due to the sensors being within 5m of the master RPi and the throughput still being more than acceptable for the amount of data that will be transmitted. The Nano 33 BLE satisfies the very important power constraint, while also having little to no drawbacks in function. Another benefit of the 33 BLE is its size, as it is Arduino’s smallest board, measuring at 45x18mm. Size is an important aspect due to the location of the microcontrollers being along the metal pipes of the bike. This small microcontroller will be out of the way and will be very easy to conceal in an effort to improve the design of the Mario Kart Bike. For the speed sensor’s microcontroller, the Nano 33 BLE Sense was chosen. This microcontroller is exactly the same as the standard Nano 33 BLE, with the addition of a few built in sensors. One of these sensors is a light sensor that will be specifically needed when measuring the revolutions of the tire, which leads to speed. An infrared light will be sent between the outer wheel and the axel, hitting the spokes of the bike as the user pedals. With the light sensor from the BLE Sense on the other side of the wheel, the breaks in the light can be used to calculate the speed of the user, instead of the current method that uses tape along the bike. The BLE Sense is also helpful in that the light sensor is built into the microcontroller, meaning that everything needed is housed together and extra wiring is not required.

Coding of the Bluetooth modules and their respective microcontrollers will be accomplished in the Arduino IDE. This text editing platform is specifically used to program and communicate with Arduino hardware. Code will be written in C++ or C, as our team has the most experience with this language. Designation of microcontrollers is important, with the sensor’s microcontrollers being peripheral, strictly sending data. The RPi housed in the main component box will be considered the central microcontroller, or master, mainly receiving data from the peripheral microcontrollers and potentially controlling them if necessary.

Bluetooth also uses a concept of profiles. Profiles are a specification for Bluetooth communication that basically create a set of rules that allow certain tasks to be accomplished. Our sensors will be strictly sending bit data to a central RPi, so the Serial Port Profile (SPP) will be used. This profile defines how to set up virtual serial ports and connect two Bluetooth enabled devices. As of now, the central RPi does not have a Bluetooth module, so one must be purchased for the purpose of providing Bluetooth connectivity. The HC-05 module seems to be the best fit, because it works as master or slave (flexible), is compatible with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and BLE Sense and supports the SPP Bluetooth profile. 

Once the analysis of the design was determined to be satisfactory using the schematic and mathematical calculations, the materials needed to implement the new design of the speed and steering sensors were priced. The most economical purchasing option for the batteries was selected to ensure adequate quantities for the initial testing, standard use, and spares. The price for these materials were reviewed against the proposed budget and determined to be within range. To further promote safety, proper disposal of batteries drained of power will be performed by wrapping electrical tape on both ends of each battery to ensure that an object does not make a connection between the positive and negative ends of the battery, resulting in a fire during disposal.

# RRSA Testing

**Sync Test:**
For the initial test, recording was started, and the device was raised into the air 23 s after beginning recording. The collected video verifies that this is the timestamp at which the device was raised, and the collected data show a decrease in barometric pressure beginning at this time. The last data index corresponds to the ending timestamp of the video for both pressure and speed data.

In testing of the pressure sensor, similar correspondance of the change in elevation seen in the video and the change in pressure values was observed indicating successful syncing.
